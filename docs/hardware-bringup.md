# GuessWork — Implementation Status & Hardware Bring-Up Plan

*Last updated: 2026-09-12 (MicoAir USB/IMU and clock-sync bench test passed; camera/output acceptance pending)*

GuessWork is the onboard pose-estimation system for an FRC robot: a Mac Mini M4
runs 6 hardware-synced FLIR Chameleon3 cameras (4 AprilTag + 2 stereo VIO), a
BMI088 IMU integrated on a MicoAir F405 V2 that drives the camera triggers
(the timestamp ground truth). The robot controller (RoboRIO today, SystemCore next season)
talks to the Mac **directly over UDP on the robot LAN** — chassis speeds in,
fused pose out (`docs/ethernet-protocol.md`). AprilTag poses, OpenVINS
visual-inertial odometry, and controller chassis speeds fuse in a GTSAM
factor graph (Phase 6).

```

**Single time domain:** every measurement (frames, IMU samples, chassis
speeds) carries a sync-controller-clock nanosecond timestamp. Frames are
re-stamped from trigger pulses; the IMU is stamped on the controller before
transit; chassis speeds carry the robot controller's FPGA sample time, mapped
RIO→host→sync controller by
the two-hop `ClockSync` chain (arrival fallback while the RIO hop warms up).
No raw host clocks are ever used for estimation math.

## 1. What's implemented

### Phase 1 — MicoAir timebase, binary USB, onboard BMI088
| Piece | Status |
|---|---|
| TIM2 1 MHz wrap-extended 64-bit timebase shared by triggers and IMU | ✅ firmware builds; host parse unit-tested |
| One bidirectional USB CDC stream with versioned frames, request IDs, lengths, and CRC16 | ✅ decoder golden-byte tested; five-minute real USB run with zero CRC errors |
| Onboard BMI088: 400 Hz scheduled SPI reads, board-frame rotation, heartbeat/drop counters | ✅ five-minute first-board stream at 400 Hz, zero drops; **axis orientation and camera timing acceptance pending** |
| Host: `SyncProtocolDecoder`, `MeasurementBus<ImuSample>`, single-port `SyncControllerManager`, reconnect/config replay, `/api/imu/*` | ✅ unit/PTY tests and five-minute real manager + IMU bus test; clock sync healthy at ~22 ppm |

### Phase 2 — Calibration: multi-topic bags, camera-IMU extrinsics
| Piece | Status |
|---|---|
| Multi-connection `RosbagWriter` + `sensor_msgs/Imu` | ✅ validated against real `rosbag info` + genpy deserialization in the Kalibr container |
| `MultiTopicBagRecorder` (N cams + `/imu0`, sync-controller stamps, zero-stamp drop) | ✅ unit-tested with synthetic frames/IMU |
| Extrinsics sessions in `CalibrationSupervisor` (validation gates: hw-sync controller armed, IMU healthy) + `calibrate_imu.sh` (single-cam + stereo-pair Kalibr flows) + `KalibrImuJob` per-camera result fan-out | ✅ code + failure paths live-verified; **end-to-end run on the new board pending** |
| Typed `CalibrationStore` (camchain parse/serialize), `cameras.role`, `imu_extrinsics_json` | ✅ unit-tested round-trips |
| Single-camera intrinsics flow (Phase 0 era) | ✅ live-verified end-to-end with the real camera |

### Phase 3 — AprilTag detection pipeline
| Piece | Status |
|---|---|
| `gw_apriltag`: zero-copy tag36h11 detection on the locked IOSurface; SQPNP multi-tag / IPPE_SQUARE single-tag with ambiguity gate; numeric-Jacobian 6×6 covariance (GTSAM body-tangent) | ✅ synthetic-projection tests incl. **500-draw NEES** statistical covariance validation; rendered-real-tag end-to-end test caught (and fixed) the IPPE frame-convention bug |
| `ConsumerFactory` on `CameraSupervisor` (slot-lifecycle-safe attach/detach, rebuild-in-place on role/calibration change) | ✅ unit + live-verified (role flips rebuild consumers live) |
| WPILib field layouts (2026-rebuilt-welded seeded + auto-activated), `T_robot_imu` schema + validation, `/api/field-layouts*`, `/api/apriltag/status` | ✅ live-verified |
| Measured performance | ✅ **12.8 ms latency at 55 det/s, 2048×1536** on the M4 (4 detector threads; vendored detector forced -O2) |
| Range accuracy vs a real printed tag | ⬜ **hardware-pending** (needs a printed tag) |

### Phase 4 — OpenVINS stereo VIO
| Piece | Status |
|---|---|
| OpenVINS ROS-free build on macOS arm64 (`cmake/openvins.cmake`, pinned SHA; Boost 1.90 + cassert fixes) | ✅ spike-built + smoke-ran (VioManager constructed, IMU fed) |
| `StereoSyncPairer` (exact pulse-stamp equality), `VioFeederConsumer`s, single-threaded `OpenVinsRunner`, `epoch` reinit contract, calibration-quality gating, `/api/vio/*` | ✅ unit-tested (pairer rules, config builder goldens, covariance conversion vs hand-computed J·P·Jᵀ); gating progression live-verified |
| Actual VIO tracking on real imagery | ⬜ **hardware-pending** (needs the stereo rig + IMU) |

### Phase 5 — Robot link (controller ↔ Mac over UDP)

*(Reworked 2026-07: the microcontroller CAN bridge was retired in favor of
direct UDP. The MicoAir board only owns triggers, IMU, and their clock.)*

| Piece | Status |
|---|---|
| `RobotLink` (src/net): UDP RX thread, address learning, chassis-speeds decode → OdomBus; POSE downlink (x/y/θ + quality + mode + planar covariance + rolling counter) at `output_hz` | ✅ unit-tested end-to-end over localhost UDP (`test_robot_link`) |
| Wire contract `src/net/udp_payloads.h` (32-byte CHASSIS_SPEEDS, 64-byte POSE, full 64-bit FPGA timestamps — no wrap handling anywhere) | ✅ golden-byte unit-tested (`test_udp_payloads`) |
| Two-hop clock sync `gw::ClockSync` — RIO↔host (fed by UDP arrivals, in RobotLink) and host↔sync controller (fed by multiplexed IMU/TRIG arrivals, in `SyncControllerManager`); chassis speeds mapped RIO→host→controller | ✅ unit-tested (fit/drift/reset suite + loopback chain test) |
| `net_config` table, `/api/robot/*` routes (status incl. both sync hops, config incl. rebind, bench pose) | ✅ unit-tested (repo) + route layer |
| Chassis speeds at 100 Hz from a real controller, two-hop sync quality on real crystals, pose downlink visible in robot code, field-network behavior | ⬜ **hardware-pending** (needs a RoboRIO + robot LAN — Stage 6) |

Protocol reference: **`docs/ethernet-protocol.md`** (packet layouts,
time-sync scheme, controller-side WPILib reference class).

### Phase 6 — GTSAM fusion engine
| Piece | Status |
|---|---|
| `gw_fusion`: IncrementalFixedLagSmoother (GTSAM 4.3a1 from source, Boost-free) fusing tag priors (Mahalanobis-gated + Huber), VIO equal-epoch deltas (robot-frame conjugation + Adjoint cov transport, lazily attached to in-lag keys), chassis-speeds twist betweens (Cauchy, slip-robust, soft planarity) | ✅ **hardware-free simulation suite**: figure-8 truth, clean-run RMSE < 5 cm / < 2°, 10 % outlier tags rejected, collision detect+recover, VIO death degradation, epoch-reset safety, tag drought > lag, std-explosion reinit |
| Medoid init, collision monitor (gate-open + noise inflation), auto-reinit (pos-std / solver throw / NaN / unresolved collision), connectivity bridge factors, solve-time p95 tracking | ✅ unit-tested via the same suite |
| `FusionSupervisor` (3 bus drainers → engine thread → output thread), `SyncClockNowEstimator`, planar extrapolation → `RobotLink::send_pose` at `output_hz` | ✅ unit-tested (estimator, extrapolation) + live-server verified |
| Fused pose accuracy on a real field course; solve-time budget under real measurement rates; VIO-kill / collision behavior on hardware | ⬜ **hardware-pending** (Stage 7 — needs the full rig) |

### Phase 7 — Hardening & ops
| Piece | Status |
|---|---|
| Per-stage latency instrumentation in `/api/fusion/status` (`tag_pulse_to_fusion`, `queue_wait`, `solve`, **`pose_staleness`** — target p95 < 50 ms) + degraded-mode `mode`; controller-now estimate is also tag-fed | ✅ unit-tested (`LatencyStats`, `derive_fusion_mode`) + threaded supervisor integration test + live-server verified |
| Degraded-modes matrix (docs/pose_pipeline.md §6) + new engine sim cases (odom death, tags-only) | ✅ simulation-tested; matrix rows mirror the mode unit tests 1:1 |
| Allan-variance IMU refinement, fully API-integrated: `POST /api/imu/allan/recording` → binary log in `~/.guesswork/imu_logs/` → `analyze` (overlapping ADEV, N/K fits, static-ness warnings) → `apply` into imu_config | ✅ math unit-tested (synthetic white noise + random walk recovered ±10–25%); recorder bit-exact-tested; **real overnight BMI088 recording pending (Stage 8 prep)** |
| Config snapshot export/import (`/api/config/export\|import`): cameras incl. calibration blobs, trigger groups, field layouts, all tunables; non-destructive merge with per-section error reporting | ✅ round-trip + conflict-case unit tests + live verified |
| `scripts/soak_check.sh` + threaded `test_fusion_supervisor` (the TSAN target) + `docs/pose_pipeline.md` | ✅ in repo; sanitizer soak itself is Stage 8 |

**Test inventory:** 292 tests are discovered. The 18 protocol, decoder,
controller-manager, and controller-clock replacement tests pass; the full
suite additionally needs normal macOS media-service access and free robot-link
UDP ports. What remains for this replacement is hardware execution (Stages
0–8) and data-driven tuning.

## 2. What still needs real hardware

Nothing below can be validated in software — each item exercises a physical
interface or a real-world signal path:

1. **Board power + firmware flash** — verify whether USB energizes the 5V
   pad, then flash the MicoAir build through STM32 DFU.
2. **IMU rate/health + timestamp soak** — validate 400 Hz scheduled reads,
   board-axis rotation, and a >90-minute wrap-crossing soak.
3. **Trigger polarity and mapping** — scope LOW idle / 100 µs HIGH windows
   on M1–M6 and verify falling-edge Line0 capture on every logical output.
4. **Camera-IMU extrinsics end-to-end** — record a real extrinsics bag, run
   `kalibr_calibrate_imu_camera`, verify the result lands in the DB. The
   reported `timeshift_cam_imu` doubles as a whole-system clock check.
5. **AprilTag range accuracy** — printed 6.5 in tag at tape-measured
   distances; the published field pose against a measured bench layout.
6. **Pipeline resilience** — USB camera yank/replug mid-run for both the
   AprilTag consumer and the VIO feeders.
7. **OpenVINS tracking quality** — initialization, the 5 m loop drift test,
   bump/shake auto-reinit, and the CPU budget.
8. **Multi-camera scaling** — all 6 cameras + IMU at once on one USB
   topology (bandwidth + CPU).
9. **Robot-link bench** — chassis speeds from a real controller at 100 Hz
   over UDP, two-hop clock-sync health/drift on real crystals, pose
   downlink visible in robot code, cable-pull recovery.
10. **Fused pose on a real course** — waypoint accuracy against a tape
    measure, solve-time budget at real measurement rates, VIO-kill
    degradation and physical collision/jostle behavior.

## 3. Hardware test plan

Run the stages in order — each builds on the previous one. Start the server
with `./build/guesswork` (default port 8080; substitute below).

### Stage 0 — Flash & smoke (≈ 30 min)

**USB/IMU bench portion passed on 2026-09-12.** The corrected production
firmware is installed on board USB serial `388638683335`. A five-minute run
through the real `SyncControllerManager` and `MeasurementBus<ImuSample>`
received 120,423 samples at 400 Hz in the device clock (host status ~401 Hz).
Clock sync remained healthy at every one-second check after the ten-second
warm-up allowance; final drift was 22 ppm, within the 200 ppm limit.
There were zero firmware drops, USB errors, CRC errors, subscriber drops,
nonfinite values, or nonmonotonic timestamps. Sample intervals were
2458–2541 us. Mean acceleration magnitude was 9.813 m/s²; motion response
was observed (peak gyro magnitude 12.006 rad/s), but individual axis
directions have not been verified. Outputs stayed unarmed throughout.

Local test evidence: `firmware/.pio/bringup/host-crystal.log`; the bench
harness source is `firmware/.pio/bringup/host_smoke.cpp`. Flashed binary
SHA-256: `ca047259331db106d0a2630af46ae3496bb6244074e33dd609959df0835d7411`.
The HTTP/UI path was not part of this run. The 5V pad measurement, physical
output checks, axis verification, camera integration, and 90-minute soak
remain pending.

**2026-09-12 first-board observations:** USB-only power and STM32 ROM DFU
worked after reconnecting with BOOT held. The factory 1 MiB flash was backed
up locally at `firmware/.pio/backups/micoair-388638683335-factory.bin` before
flashing. The project firmware enumerated as one CDC port and answered
`HELLO` and `STOP`; the initial 10-second check received valid heartbeats
with no CRC errors, but `imu_ok` was false and no samples were produced.

A temporary diagnostic build read the correct BMI088 IDs (`0x1E`, `0x0F`)
and configured registers. Gyro bandwidth register `0x10` returned `0x83`;
the original exact comparison with `0x03` incorrectly rejected it. The
production fix preserves upper bits on write and validates the bandwidth
field with Bosch's `0x0F` mask. Flashing that fix restored `imu_ok` and IMU
samples, but the stream was only about 50 Hz with increasing scheduling
drops. The pinned STM32duino `USBSerial::operator bool()` calls `delay(10)`;
the firmware used it both in the main loop and for every transmitted frame.
Both checks now read `Serial.dtr()` directly. A host test compiles the real
firmware loop against a USB model with that 10 ms conversion delay and
checks sampling and disconnect-stop behavior. All 17 relevant tests pass.

After flashing both fixes, a 300-second direct USB run received 120,445 IMU
samples: 401.483 Hz against the Mac clock, 400.000 Hz against device
timestamps, zero nonmonotonic timestamps, zero CRC errors, and zero IMU,
trigger, or USB drops. Timestamp intervals were 2458–2543 us; mean measured
acceleration magnitude was 9.805 m/s². Outputs remained stopped.

The real `SyncControllerManager` then connected and received healthy IMU
data, but clock synchronization stayed unhealthy with over 3,000 ppm drift.
The generic Arduino variant uses HSI (internal RC); `HSE_VALUE` alone does
not select the board's crystal. `firmware/src/system_clock.cpp` now selects
the 8 MHz HSE crystal for the 168 MHz system / 48 MHz USB clocks. Flashing
this build resolved the clock-sync fault, as verified by the passing run
above.

Reference: [Bosch gyro register definitions](https://github.com/boschsensortec/BMI08x_SensorAPI/blob/master/bmi08_defs.h).

1. With camera wiring disconnected, power by USB and measure the 5V pad;
   follow the fallback rule in `docs/micoair-f405-v2.md`.
2. Enter DFU mode and flash:
   `cd firmware && pio run -e micoair_f405_v2 -t upload`.
3. Reconnect normally. The Mac should enumerate **one** `cu.usbmodem*`
   interface.
4. `GET /api/imu/status` → expect `controller_connected: true`,
   `board: "micoair_f405_v2"`, `protocol_version: 1`, `imu_ok: true`,
   `rate_hz ≈ 400`, `crc_errors: 0`.
   - `imu_ok: false` indicates an onboard SPI/identity/configuration problem.
5. Shake the board; sanity-check accel/gyro magnitudes move (watch
   `last_sample_age_ms` stay near 0).

**Pass:** 400 ±5 Hz sustained, zero CRC errors over 5 minutes.

### Stage 1 — Trigger regression + clock soak (1.5 h, mostly unattended)

1. Create a trigger group (e.g. 30 fps, the pins your cameras are wired to)
   via `POST /api/hardware-sync/groups`, then `POST /api/hardware-sync/arm`.
2. Set each camera `hardware_sync_enabled: true` + its `trigger_output_pin`.
3. `GET /api/status` → camera `fps_1s` matches the group fps (trigger-driven,
   not freerun) — confirms binary TRIGGER parsing + pulse re-stamping.
4. **Soak:** leave everything running > 90 minutes (past the old `micros()`
   wrap), then confirm frames and IMU are still flowing and an extrinsics
   recording started after the soak doesn't error on non-monotonic stamps.

**Pass:** synced fps correct; no stamp anomalies after 90+ min.

### Stage 2 — Calibration (one camera first) (≈ 1 h)

1. **Intrinsics** (per camera): `POST /api/cameras/<id>/calibration/recording`,
   wave the AprilGrid 30–60 s covering the full field of view, `DELETE` to
   stop — the Kalibr job auto-runs (watch the SSE log at
   `…/calibration/job/log`). Target reprojection error < 0.3 px.
2. **Camera-IMU extrinsics** (the Phase 2 marquee test):
   - Prereqs auto-checked by the API: hw-sync on, sync controller armed, IMU healthy,
     stored intrinsics matching the live mode.
   - `POST /api/calibration/extrinsics/recording {"camera_ids": [<id>]}`.
   - **Motion recipe (Kalibr needs excitation):** grid fixed and well-lit,
     exposure ≤ 2 ms (no motion blur); 60–90 s; pause ~2 s still at start and
     end; excite **all 6 DOF** — 3× rotation swings (~30–45°) about each
     axis, 3× translations along each axis, then combined figure-eights;
     keep the grid mostly in frame; no impacts.
   - `DELETE …/recording` → job runs both Kalibr steps; result stored per
     camera in `imu_extrinsics_json`.
3. **Acceptance:** in the stored YAML (`GET /api/cameras/<id>/extrinsics`):
   - `timeshift_cam_imu` **≪ 1 ms** — this single number validates the whole
     shared sync-controller clock design end-to-end. If it's large, the pulse
     re-stamping path is broken: stop and debug before anything else.
   - `T_cam_imu` translation matches the tape measure to ~1 cm.
   - `guesswork_meta.reprojection_error_std_px < 1.0` (the VIO gate).

### Stage 3 — AprilTag bench (≈ 1 h)

1. Camera with stored intrinsics, `role: "apriltag"`.
2. **Range:** printed tag at tape-measured 1 m / 2 m / 4 m (camera aperture →
   tag center). `GET /api/apriltag/status` → `last_tags[].range_m` within
   **1–2 %** at each distance; `last_latency_ms < 15`; `det_per_s` ≈ camera fps.
3. **Field pose:** set a bench `T_robot_imu` (identity is fine:
   `PUT /api/imu/config {"t_imu_robot": {"T_robot_imu": [[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]]}}`),
   make sure the camera has IMU extrinsics from Stage 2, and `POST
   /api/field-layouts` a single-tag bench layout placing the tag at a
   measured pose. Published `T_field_robot` (in status `last_pose`) must
   match the tape-measured camera placement within **±3 cm / ±2°**.
4. **Multi-tag:** two tags on a wall at measured spacing → reprojection
   < 1 px and visibly tighter covariance than single-tag.
5. **Resilience:** yank the camera USB mid-run, replug → status shows
   offline/online transitions, detection resumes, **no crash** (this is the
   ConsumerFactory lifecycle acceptance test).

### Stage 4 — Stereo VIO rig (≈ half a day)

Prereq: both VIO cameras rigidly mounted, BMI088 hard-mounted by the left
camera, both calibrated through Stage 2 (the **pair** flow:
`POST /api/calibration/extrinsics/recording {"camera_ids": [<left>, <right>]}`
— it solves cam-cam + cam-IMU in one session).

1. Roles `vio_left` / `vio_right`; both in **one trigger group @ 30 fps**.
2. `GET /api/vio/status` must show `reason: "ok"`, `running: true` — if not,
   the reason string says exactly which gate failed (missing role, missing
   extrinsics, calibration quality above `max_reproj_std_px`).
3. **Initialization:** pick the rig up, move gently — `initialized: true`
   within ~2 s. If it never initializes, lower
   `init_imu_thresh` territory… first check `counters.paired` is climbing and
   `dropped_unmatched ≈ 0` (pairing health), and `imu_rate_hz ≈ 400`.
4. **5 m loop drift:** tape a start line; walk the rig 5 m out and back to
   the exact start; compare `last_pose.T_odom_imu` translation at return vs
   start. **Pass: < 5 cm (< 1 %).**
5. **Bump/shake reinit:** strike the rig hard. Expect divergence detection
   (`reinits` increments, `epoch` bumps) and recovery to `tracking` within
   ~5 s. The epoch contract means downstream fusion never sees a pose jump.
6. **CPU budget:** `top` — the guesswork process should stay ≤ ~1.5 cores
   for VIO (levers if over: `downsample` is already on; drop `num_pts` to
   100 via `PUT /api/vio/config`).
7. **Resilience:** unplug one VIO camera → feeder drops out of status, the
   runner idles; replug → the >2 s frame-gap triggers a clean reinit.

### Stage 5 — Full-system soak (when all 6 cameras exist)

1. All 6 cameras + IMU, two trigger groups (apriltag @ 30 fps, VIO @ 30 fps),
   streaming + AprilTag + VIO running simultaneously.
2. Watch for USB bandwidth saturation (`frames_incomplete` in `/api/status`)
   — Chameleon3s at full res are ~95 MB/s each; spread across separate USB3
   controllers/hubs if drops appear.
3. 3-hour soak; ideally repeat once under the TSAN preset
   (`build-tsan/`, reduced rates) before competition use.

### Stage 6 — Robot-link bench with a RoboRIO (≈ 2 h; independent of Stages 2–5)

No wiring beyond Ethernet: Mac (static IP) and RoboRIO on one switch.
Controller-side test program: the `GuessWorkLink` reference class in
`docs/ethernet-protocol.md` §5, sending ChassisSpeeds at 100 Hz with
`RobotController.getFPGATime()` and logging received poses.

1. `GET /api/robot/status` → `running: true`, `bind_port: 5809`.
2. Start the RIO program. **Pass:** `odom.rate_hz ≈ 100`,
   `odom.counter_gaps ≈ 0`, `odom.rejected: 0`, `robot_addr` shows the RIO,
   `odom.last` carries the commanded speeds.
3. **Clock sync (both hops):**
   `clock_sync.rio_host.healthy: true` within ~2 s of RIO packets;
   `clock_sync.host_sync_controller.healthy: true` within ~2 s of the sync-controller
   telemetry (IMU or armed triggers); `|drift_ppm| < 100` on both;
   `offset_us` stable to ±0.5 ms over 10 min. Record both hops' numbers —
   they are the headline metrics for this stage.
4. **Controller reboot:** restart the RIO code mid-run →
   `rio_host.resets` increments once, healthy again < 2 s, no stale
   mappings (odometry `t_ns` stays monotonic).
5. **Pose downlink:** `POST /api/robot/pose {"x":1.0,"y":2.0,"theta":0.5}`
   in a loop → RIO program sees x/y/theta with an advancing counter and the
   degraded-mode byte; `pose.sent` tracks it. With `rio_host` healthy the
   packets carry a mapped `rio_time_us` (flags bit0 set) — log
   `getFPGATime() − rio_time_us` on the RIO: it should sit at a stable few
   ms (transport + output quantization), not jump around.
6. **Cable pull:** yank the Ethernet cable 5 s, replug → rates recover on
   their own, `rio_host.resets` unchanged or +1, no restarts needed.
7. With the IMU also wired: confirm `imu.rate_hz ≈ 400` is unaffected at
   100 Hz odom (separate paths now — USB vs UDP — so this should be trivially
   true; it pins the regression anyway).

**Pass:** steps 2–6 green; the headline numbers to record are both hops'
`drift_ppm` and offset stability bands, and the RIO-side
`getFPGATime() − rio_time_us` latency figure.

### Stage 7 — Fusion field course (after Stages 3, 4, and 6 pass)

Requires: ≥2 calibrated AprilTag cameras + the stereo VIO rig + IMU + the
robot-link bench (chassis speeds flowing). Tape a small course (3×3 m is enough)
with 4–6 printed tags at surveyed positions entered as a custom field layout;
mark 5+ waypoints with tape-measured field coordinates.

1. All sources up: `GET /api/fusion/status` → `initialized: true` within a
   second of tags being visible, `sources.*` rates live, `solve_ms.p95` well
   under `min_state_dt_ms` (25 ms).
2. **Waypoint accuracy:** park the robot on each waypoint → fused
   `pose.x_m/y_m` within **±3 cm** and heading within **±2°** of the tape
   measurements. Watch `quality` sit high (> 200).
3. **Motion:** push the robot around the course at walking pace —
   `tag.rejected_gate` stays near zero, no `reinits`, pose tracks visibly in
   the status output.
4. **VIO kill:** cover the stereo cameras (or `PUT /api/vio/config
   {"enabled":false}`) mid-run → fusion continues on tags + chassis speeds;
   `sources.vio.rate_hz` drops to 0, no reinit, accuracy degrades but stays
   bounded.
5. **Collision:** physically jolt/slide the robot (wheels not rolling) →
   `collision_mode: true` within ~1 s, pose snaps to the tag solution within
   2 s, collision mode clears, `reinits` unchanged.
6. **Tag blackout:** cover all tags > 5 s → `quality` decays, no exception;
   uncover → recovery within a second.
7. **Downlink:** confirm the RIO test program sees the fused pose at
   `output_hz` with an advancing counter and a sensible mode byte
   (`output.sent` tracking `pose.sent` in /api/robot/status).

**Pass:** waypoints ±3 cm/±2°, `solve_ms.p95` < 25 ms,
`latency.pose_staleness.p95_ms` < 50 (the trigger-pulse→pose-on-the-wire
headline), all degradation scenarios recover without manual intervention.
The covariance/sigma tuning loop starts from whatever this stage measures.

### Stage 8 — 3-hour sanitizer soak + Allan refinement (overnight + 1 day)

**Prep (overnight before the soak):** with the robot powered and perfectly
still (IMU rigid, nobody touching the cart):
`POST /api/imu/allan/recording {"duration_s": 28800}` (8 h). In the morning:
`POST /api/imu/allan/analyze` → review per-axis fits + warnings (motion
heuristics, fit-quality flags) → `POST /api/imu/allan/apply` to replace the
datasheet noise values in imu_config. Less than 3 h of data earns an
explicit "random-walk fit unreliable" warning — don't apply those.

**Sanitizer builds** (one-time per dir; the first configure builds GTSAM +
OpenVINS again inside each dir — budget 30–60 min each):

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-tsan -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DGW_ENABLE_TSAN=ON && cmake --build build-tsan -j
cmake -S . -B build-asan -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DGW_ENABLE_ASAN=ON && cmake --build build-asan -j
```

Note: the GTSAM/OpenVINS ExternalProjects are **not instrumented** (they
configure independently of our sanitizer flags). Acceptable by design — the
fusion engine thread is GTSAM's only user and OpenVINS is fed
single-threaded; our own threading is fully instrumented. The headline
software check runs without hardware:
`TSAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=1 build-tsan/gw_tests --gtest_filter='FusionSupervisor*'`.

**Soak runs** (all cameras + IMU attached, triggers armed, RIO test
program streaming over UDP):

```bash
TSAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=1:second_deadlock_stack=1 ./build-tsan/guesswork &
scripts/soak_check.sh --duration-s 10800
# then again with:
MallocNanoZone=0 ASAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=1:abort_on_error=1:detect_leaks=0 \
UBSAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=1:print_stacktrace=1 ./build-asan/guesswork &
scripts/soak_check.sh --duration-s 10800
```

(Reduce camera rates under TSAN if frame drops appear — the 5–15× slowdown
is expected; the soak is hunting races and leaks, not throughput.)

**Pass:** zero sanitizer reports across both 3-hour runs; `soak_check.sh`
prints PASS (flat crc/exception/queue-drop counters, reinits ≤ 3,
`pose_staleness` p95 < 50 ms, RSS growth < 20% from the 5-minute baseline).

### Record as you go

Append results (dates, measured numbers, any tuning changes like
`init_imu_thresh`) to this file — Stage 2's `timeshift_cam_imu`, Stage 4's
drift number, Stage 6's two-hop clock-sync stability, and Stage 7's waypoint error
are the headline metrics worth tracking over time.

## 4. What comes after hardware sign-off

The software roadmap (Phases 1–7) is complete. What remains is data-driven:

- **Fusion covariance/sigma tuning** from Stage 7 waypoint numbers — every
  knob is live-tunable via `PUT /api/fusion/config`.
- **Allan-refined IMU noise** (Stage 8 prep) feeding both Kalibr and VIO.
- **Config snapshot discipline:** after calibration + tuning, download
  `GET /api/config/export` and commit/back it up — it restores the robot's
  full identity (calibrations included) onto a fresh install or spare Mac.
- **Future season:** the IMU-preintegration fallback for VIO-unhealthy via
  the reserved `feed_imu` seam (`src/fusion/fusion_engine.hpp`).

## 5. Bench results log

### 2026-07-03 — legacy Teensy Stage 0 + Stage 1 baseline

These retained results establish the performance and low-side wiring that
the MicoAir replacement must meet; they do not constitute acceptance of the
new board.

Setup: 1× CM3-U3-31S4M (serial 17301963, 6 mm lens), Teensy 4.1 + BMI088,
fw=4, M4 Mac. Trigger wire: output 1 (pin 2), low-side (see below).

- **Stage 0 PASS** — fw=4 flashed via PlatformIO (`teensy.app` loader; the
  CLI loader can't open the HID device on macOS). Dual CDC enumerates.
  `imu_ok: true`, **399.7 Hz sustained, 0 CRC errors** — first real BMI088
  samples. Host↔Teensy clock sync healthy, drift fit **≈1–2 ppm**.
  Spinnaker runtime needs Homebrew `libusb` (added to install.sh).
- **Stage 1 PASS (fps-lock)** — camera slaved to the 30 fps trigger group:
  **30.02–30.04 fps** (freerun is ~55), 0 dropped / 0 incomplete.
- **Stage 1 soak PASS (83 min, past the old 71.6-min wrap point)** —
  136,507 frames at 29.93 fps locked, 0 dropped / 0 incomplete; 146,671
  pulses (30/s throughout); IMU 400.4 Hz, 1.92 M samples, **0 CRC errors**;
  host↔Teensy clock fit healthy at 1.5 ppm over 30 k samples; RSS flat at
  ~98 MB. (`fw_drops`/sync-reset counters are cumulative from the earlier
  bench debugging — verified static during the soak.) One item rolls into
  Stage 2: the post-soak extrinsics-recording stamp check is gated on
  stored intrinsics.
- **Finding 1 (wiring, fixed):** the CM3 opto input does NOT register a
  3.3 V high-side drive. Working scheme: OPTO_IN (pin 9, yellow) → Teensy
  VIN 5 V; OPTO_GND (pin 7, brown) → trigger pin (low-side switch);
  producer uses TriggerActivation=FallingEdge. docs/micoair-f405-v2.md
  §1 rewritten; earlier revisions also had OPTO_IN/OPTO_GND wire colors
  swapped. The legacy firmware's `TEST_PIN pin=<1..6> level=<0|1>` command
  held an output steady for multimeter / LineStatusAll verification; the
  MicoAir firmware replaces it with the bounded `TEST_OUTPUT` pulse.
- **Finding 2 (clock sync, fixed):** feeding the host↔Teensy ClockSync from
  both IMU (telemetry CDC, up to ~15 ms batch lag) and TRIG (command CDC,
  ~1 ms) interleaved non-monotonic stamps and reset-thrashed the
  backward-jump detector (~90 resets/s). TRIG is now a fallback feed only
  while the IMU stream is stale >500 ms (teensy_manager.cpp).
- **Finding 3 (RESOLVED — root-caused + 3 fix layers):** intermittent
  "Teensy command timeout" (~7% of commands on a raw-port harness, worst
  right after STOP). Root cause: short responses ("OK\r\n") stuck in the
  Teensy USB-CDC partial-packet buffer when the core's flush timer loses
  its race — the ack only ships when the NEXT write generates traffic.
  Fixes: (1) firmware calls `Serial.send_now()` after every command
  response and TRIG flush batch (harness: 0/160 timeouts after, worst ack
  2.6 ms); (2) host `send_command` retries once (all protocol commands are
  idempotent); (3) **armed state is now persisted operator intent**
  (`sync_config` table, additive) — the arm/stop routes store it before
  pushing, main.cpp seeds the desired config at boot, and TeensyManager
  retries failed pushes every 3 s until the device converges. Verified: 5×
  server cold-starts with ZERO API calls each converged to armed + 30 fps.
  Field behavior: power the robot on and walk away.
- **Operational note:** auto-exposure in a dim room drives exposure toward
  ~90 ms and the camera silently retires only ~6 of the 30 triggers/s. Set
  manual exposure (bench: 8 ms → instant 30 fps lock); calibration wants
  ≤2 ms anyway.
